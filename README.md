# Persistent-Kelp- Nur Arafeh Dalmau- The University of Queensland
Repository for Communications Earth & Environment paper
This repository contains the kelp forest persistence information used in this study, and the codes used to estimate the representation of the present kelp and the adjusted representation targets. We also include the code used to create the bar plots for Figure 1 and 2 and the
results from the GIS spatial overlap analysis (persistence and protected areas).

You will find four codes

1) Barplots: code to create bar plots figure for Figure 1 and 2. 

2) Boxplots: code used to create Supplementary Figure 2.

3) Dynamics: code to create Figure 1d for the kelp time series (area).

4) Multiplier: code to estimate the persistence values,  the representation targets, 
adjusted representation targets, and other estimates related to Table 1-3.

You will also find five csvs. These csvs contain the persistence data set and kelp time series and the results of the GIS spatial overlap analysis.
